# Information Learning Goals

[**Goal 1**](https://github.com/gerardathletics/SmartEnvironments-PersonalPortfolio/tree/master/Information/Goal-1): **“I would like to learn how to do a sentiment analysis on a text with python”** 
  * **Background**: I had never done something similar. I had read that some libraries and machine learning algorithms could do that. 
  * **How?** I will explore different methodologies to achieve that. Some specific libraries and machine learning algorithms can help with the process.
  * **Result**: I elaborated and colaborated with the Tweets Sentiment Analysis with TextBlob Library. 

[**Goal 2**](https://github.com/gerardathletics/SmartEnvironments-PersonalPortfolio/tree/master/Information/Goal-2): **“I would like to get more confident and do nice data visualizations (with python if possible)”**. 
 * **Background**: 
 * **How?** I will analyse the twitter and weather datasets and try to find patterns and correlations. I will represent the results in plots and some maps elaborated with python.
 * **Result**:
