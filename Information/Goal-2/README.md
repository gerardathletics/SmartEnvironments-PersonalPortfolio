# Information: Goal 2

**“I would like to get more confident and do nice data visualizations (with python if possible)”**. 
 * **Background**: I have some experience with maps and plots, specially with GIS softwares like ArcGIS or QGIS. I have not much experience with maps and plots in Python nor ArcGIS Online.  
 * **How?** I will analyse the twitter and weather datasets and try to find patterns and correlations. I will represent the results in plots and some maps elaborated with python.
 
## Results
I ended up doing a lot of the cartographic work from the different analysis.

* **Python**

* **QGIS**
  * In QGIS, firstly, I read the output CSV files from the pre-processing and cleaning to geolocalize all the tweets in order to analyse them.
