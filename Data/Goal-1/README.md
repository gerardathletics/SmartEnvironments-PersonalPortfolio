# DATA: GOAL 1 

**“Learning and improving how to properly and effectively clean data”** 
  * **Background**: Since now in most of the courses we’re given already clean datasets and I don’t have much experience.
 * **How?** Writing a clear code to clean effectively the twitter and weather data sets
(and possible more) with python.

## Results
**Codes**

I mainly worked in the weather data cleaning, however, I also colaborated in some parts of the twitter cleaning.
