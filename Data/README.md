# Data Learning Goals

**Goal 1**: **“Learning and improving how to properly and effectively clean data”**, since now
in most of the courses we’re given already clean datasets and I don’t have much
experience.
 * **How?** Writing a clear code to clean effectively the twitter and weather data sets
(and possible more) with python.

**Goal 2**: **“Learn how to get data with API’s”**. I know the concept, but I’ve never used it in
Python.
 * **How?** Writing a script to get more tweets. Possibly also other needed datasets
can be reached with an API.

**Goal 3**: **“I would like to learn how SQL works and be able to do some queries”**.
 * **How?** I will explore the flickr dataset as it is in a database format.
