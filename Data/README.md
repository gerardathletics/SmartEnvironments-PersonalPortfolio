# Data Learning Goals

[**Goal 1**](https://github.com/gerardathletics/SmartEnvironments-PersonalPortfolio/tree/master/Data/Goal-1): **“Learning and improving how to properly and effectively clean data”** 
  * **Background**: Since now in most of the courses we’re given already clean datasets and I don’t have much experience.
 * **How?** Writing a clear code to clean effectively the twitter and weather data sets
(and possible more) with python.
 * **Result**: I elaborated and colaborated with the weather data and twitter data cleaning.

**Goal 2**: **“Learn how to get data with API’s”**. 
 * **Background**: I know the concept, but I’ve never used it in Python.
 * **How?** Writing a script to get more tweets. Possibly also other needed datasets can be reached with an API.
 * **Result**: I learnt more about API concept, how it works and how to get data with API's. However, because other project necessities and requirements, with my group we agreed that we would not get more data, so I did not do a practical approach to this (also, I had 4 more personal goals), but apart from reading different examples on the topic I also checked two python notebooks that Arend sent me.
