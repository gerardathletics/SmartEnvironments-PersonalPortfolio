# Personal Learning Goals
## 1. Data
* “Learning and improving how to properly and effectively clean data”, since now
in most of the courses we’re given already clean datasets and I don’t have much
experience.
** Writing a clear code to clean effectively the twitter and weather data sets
(and possible more) with python.
* “Learn how to get data with API’s”. I know the concept, but I’ve never used it in
Python.
** Writing a script to get more tweets. Possibly also other needed datasets
can be reached with an API.
* “I would like to learn how SQL works and be able to do some queries”.
** I will explore the flickr dataset as it is in a database format.
