# Personal Learning Goals
## 1. Data
* **“Learning and improving how to properly and effectively clean data”**, since now
in most of the courses we’re given already clean datasets and I don’t have much
experience.
  * Writing a clear code to clean effectively the twitter and weather data sets
(and possible more) with python.
* **“Learn how to get data with API’s”**. I know the concept, but I’ve never used it in
Python.
  * Writing a script to get more tweets. Possibly also other needed datasets
can be reached with an API.
* **“I would like to learn how SQL works and be able to do some queries”**.
  * I will explore the flickr dataset as it is in a database format.
## 2. Information
* **“I would like to learn how to do a sentiment analysis on a text with python”**.
 * I will explore different methodologies to achieve that. Some specific
libraries and machine learning algorithms can help with the process.
* **“I would like to get more confident and do nice data visualizations with python”.
 * I will analyse the twitter and weather datasets and try to find patterns
and correlations. I will represent the results in plots and some maps
elaborated with python
## 3. Knowledge
