# Smart Environments Personal Portfolio 
## Gerard Porras Cantons
This is my personal portfolio for the [Smart Environments](https://ssc.wur.nl/Handbook/Course/GRS-35306) course (GRS-35306), part of [MSc. Geo-Information Science](https://www.wur.nl/en/Education-Programmes/master/MSc-programmes/MSc-Geo-Information-Science.htm) in Wageningen University and Research.
# Personal Learning Goals
## 1. [Data](https://github.com/gerardathletics/SmartEnvironments-PersonalPortfolio/tree/master/Data)
* **“Learning and improving how to properly and effectively clean data”**, since now
in most of the courses we’re given already clean datasets and I don’t have much
experience.
  * Writing a clear code to clean effectively the twitter and weather data sets
(and possible more) with python.
* **“Learn how to get data with API’s”**. I know the concept, but I’ve never used it in
Python.
  * Writing a script to get more tweets. Possibly also other needed datasets
can be reached with an API.

## 2. [Information](https://github.com/gerardathletics/SmartEnvironments-PersonalPortfolio/tree/master/Information)
* **“I would like to learn how to do a sentiment analysis on a text with python”**.
  * I will explore different methodologies to achieve that. Some specific libraries and machine learning algorithms can help with the process.
* **“I would like to get more confident and do nice data visualizations (with python if possible)”**.
  * I will analyse the twitter and weather datasets and try to find patterns
and correlations. I will represent the results in plots and some maps elaborated with python.
## 3. [Knowledge](https://github.com/gerardathletics/SmartEnvironments-PersonalPortfolio/tree/master/Knowledge)
* **“Social: I would like to learn and to know how the use of social-media (geo)data can be used to improve the society”**.
  * By reading and getting informed about it I will write a reflection (about how our twitter data can be used by private and public institutions).
