# Knowledge Learning Goals

**Goal 1**: **“Social: I would like to learn and to know how the use of social-media (geo)data can be used to improve the society”**
  
* **Background**: I know social media can provide a lot of information, but I've never seen or worked in an example of how can social media be insightful to improve the society (mainly, related to my interests, to improve cities and geographical aspects).
  
* **How**: By reading and getting informed about it I will write a reflection (about how our twitter data can be used by private and public institutions).
 
## Result 
I wrote and collaborated with my group mates on the ethical assignments which provide different reflections, one of them related to the goal 1. 
I uploaded the final ethics report which groups the different reflections we've written regarding the ethical aspects. The final part "Reflection note on ethics of governance" (pg. 5-6), is the result of the goal 1 of the knowledge learning goals.
